# Calendar App

A simple calendar application built with Python and CustomTkinter. It allows users to view months, add to-dos for specific dates, and save them to a JSON file.

## Features
- Month navigation
- Add/view to-dos for each date
- Data persistence in JSON
- Custom UI with rainbow border, has to be downloaded separately(found [here](https://github.com/MOD0912/rainbowborder)). You can exclude the rainbow border part, however that would make me sad:(

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## Usage
Run the main file:
```bash
python Calendar_t.py
```
or 
```bash
python3 Calendar_b.py
```

## Files
- `Calendar_t.py`: Main calendar UI
- `Calendar_b.py`: (Other calendar logic)
- `Rainbowborder.py`: Custom border UI
- `todo.json`: Stores to-dos
